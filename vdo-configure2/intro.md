# Goal:


After completing this scenario, users will be able to configure VDO to make

use of block level deduplication, compression, thin-provisioning to save space.


# Concepts included in this scenario:

* Install VDO

* Create a VDO volume for an XFS filesystem

* Create and write duplicate files to VDO 

* View VDO statistics to see the data efficiency 


# Example Use Case:


To reduce the amount of operational and storage costs in data centers, 

we use the deduplication and compression features in VDO to decrease 

the footprint of data.
