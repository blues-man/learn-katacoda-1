The VDO volume will need to be formatted with XFS to demonstrate 
space savings in this setup.

`mkfs.xfs -K /dev/mapper/vdo1`{{execute}}

"-K" options tells mkfs to not send discards to VDO
during the format.

Create a directory to mount our new filesystem.


`mkdir /data`{{execute}}

Mount the file system. 

`mount -o discard /dev/mapper/vdo1 /data`{{execute}}

"-o discard" option lets the filesystem know to send
discards to the thin-provisioned layer when a file is
deleted.  Discards are required to accurately report
space savings.
