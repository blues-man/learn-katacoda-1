A free block device is required to create the VDO volume.  We can use a 
temporary loopback device for this scenario.  The data for our backing 
device will exist as a file in /tmp.

The truncate command can be used to create the file.


`truncate -s 10g /tmp/vdo.trunc`{{execute}}

Now, the vdo.trunc file will be used to create the loopback
device.  losetup is used to associate a loop device with a file.


`losetup  /dev/loop1 /tmp/vdo.trunc`{{execute}}

View the loopback device using lsblk.

`lsblk`{{execute}}

<pre class="file">

</pre>

The device named loop1 is first in the list and has a size of 10G.
